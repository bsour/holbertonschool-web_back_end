## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Basic understanding of asynchronous programming concepts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-python-project.git
cd async-python-project
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow the instructions provided in each module's README file to understand how to use the different asynchronous functionalities demonstrated in this project.

## Modules

1. **0-basic_async_syntax.py**: Introduction to basic asynchronous syntax.
2. **1-concurrent_coroutines.py**: Running multiple coroutines concurrently using asyncio.
3. **2-measure_runtime.py**: Measuring the runtime of asynchronous functions and calculating average execution time.
4. **3-tasks.py**: Creating and managing asyncio Tasks.
5. **4-tasks.py**: Applying asyncio Tasks to concurrent execution of coroutines.

Each module explores a specific concept of asynchronous programming, allowing you to progressively learn and apply the techniques to your own projects.
