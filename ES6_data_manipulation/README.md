# ES6 Data Manipulation

This repository provides a set of utilities and functions that showcase the power and flexibility of ES6 features in data manipulation. From handling arrays and objects to working with new ES6 data structures like Set and Map, this project offers a comprehensive toolkit for developers looking to harness modern JavaScript capabilities.

## Features

- **Array Manipulation**: Demonstrates the use of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for powerful array transformations.
- **Typed Arrays**: Introduces the concept of ArrayBuffer and DataView for handling raw binary data.
- **Data Structures**: Explores the use of Set and Map data structures for unique data storage and key-value pair management.
