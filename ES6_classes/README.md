# Holberton ES6 Classes Project

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript classes and exercises focusing on ES6 classes. These classes demonstrate various concepts related to classes, constructors, getters, setters, inheritance, and more. The project is organized into separate files, each representing a different class or exercise.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and their respective tasks:

1. `0-classroom.js`: Implementation of a `ClassRoom` class with a constructor that accepts `maxStudentsSize` as an attribute.
   
2. `1-make_classrooms.js`: A function named `initializeRooms` that returns an array of `ClassRoom` objects with different sizes.
   
3. `2-hbtn_course.js`: Implementation of a `HolbertonCourse` class with a constructor and getters and setters for attributes.
   
4. `3-currency.js`: A `Currency` class with attributes and methods for displaying currency information.
   
5. `4-pricing.js`: Implementation of a `Pricing` class that uses the `Currency` class to represent prices with currency information.
   
6. `5-building.js`: A base class `Building` that serves as an abstract class and defines a method that subclasses must implement.
   
7. `6-sky_high.js`: A subclass `SkyHighBuilding` that extends the `Building` class and overrides the `evacuationWarningMessage` method.
   
8. `7-airport.js`: An `Airport` class with attributes and a custom string description method.
   
9. `8-hbtn_class.js`: Implementation of a `HolbertonClass` class that can be cast into a Number or String.
   
10. `9-hoisting.js`: Fixing and enhancing a JavaScript code snippet that uses classes and objects.

## Usage

Each file contains a set of class implementations or exercises related to ES6 classes. You can explore each file individually to understand the concepts and practice using ES6 classes.

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/holberton-es6-classes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd holberton-es6-classes
   ```

3. Run the individual files to test each class or exercise:

   ```bash
   npm run dev 0-main.js
   npm run dev 1-main.js
   # ... and so on for other files
   ```
